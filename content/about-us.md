True North Natural Resource Consulting is a forestry consulting firm specializing in relationships with landowners that range in size from small acreages, large industrial landowners, federal agencies, and every size between.  We work all over southern Oregon and beyond.  We can manage land for help with short term projects or longer term management.  We have strategic relationships with fiber purchasers and can help merchandise and manage harvest operations; along with key relationships with contractors to complete on the ground work from harvest to reforestation.
